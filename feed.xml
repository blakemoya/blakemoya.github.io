        <title>The First Post</title>
        <description>&lt;h4 id=&quot;an-introduction&quot;&gt;An Introduction&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;A journey of a thousand miles begins with a single step.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is a blog that I hope to get into the habit of using to share my projects. I think that this will be a good way to show other people what I’ve been up to and also to practice articulating what I’m doing and why. Most of what I plan to do here will just be sharing fun plots and code snippets, but I think that with time I may do a series of posts about statistical concept and linear algebra, with helpful visualizations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’ll leave this post short. Later on this week I’ll add my first real post about a fun project I did in response to Gonzalo Ciruelos’ &lt;a href=&quot;https://gciruelos.com/what-is-the-roundest-country.html&quot;&gt;What is the roundest country?&lt;/a&gt; post that went around a few years ago. Maybe after that I’ll actually lay some groundwork for what I intend to do going forward. Stay tuned!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thanks,&lt;br /&gt;
Blake&lt;/p&gt;
